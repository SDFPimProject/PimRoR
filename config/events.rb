WebsocketRails::EventMap.describe do
  # You can use this file to map incoming events to controller actions.
  # One event can be mapped to any number of controller actions. The
  # actions will be executed in the order they were subscribed.
  #
  # Uncomment and edit the next line to handle the client connected event:
  #   subscribe :client_connected, :to => Controller, :with_method => :method_name
  #
  # Here is an example of mapping namespaced events:
  #   namespace :product do
  #     subscribe :new, :to => ProductController, :with_method => :new_product
  #   end
  # The above will handle an event triggered on the client like `product.new`.

  subscribe :user_connected, 'online#new_connection'

  subscribe :client_disconnected, 'online#close_connection'
  subscribe :connection_closed, 'online#close_connection'

  namespace :notification do
    subscribe :to_all, 'notifications#push_to_all'
  end
end
